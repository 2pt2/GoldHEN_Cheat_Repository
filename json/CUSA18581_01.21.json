You may need to enable Player-No-Dead cheat to prevent dying from fall damage when using the Moon/Super-Jump cheat. For an even more advanced trainer, which also includes the stats cheats and other perks, check out my MultiTrainer2 ShnExt trainer. This trainer was made and tested on PS4 Firmware 9.00, but should also work on other firmwares. Enjoy! ;-)",
