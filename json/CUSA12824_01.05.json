      "description": "BE SURE TO READ ALL the comments where available. As a rule of thumb (for all games), ALWAYS enable only cheats that are needed and disable when they are not. You may need to enable Player-No-Dead cheat to prevent dying from fall damage when using the Moon/Super-Jump cheat. For an even more advanced trainer, check out my MultiTrainer2 ShnExt trainer. This trainer was made and tested on PS4 Firmware 9.00, but should also work on other firmwares. Credits: Some cheats were ported or derived from older game versions cheats made by TLH and/or Rizla and from the PC trainer made by FLiNG. Enjoy! ;-)",
